= Do You Need a Data Model?

A *data model* is a simplified representation of the underlying database schema. The data model reorganizes the database tables and columns to provide a simplified entity-attribute interface for users who are designing  Dashboards. For example, the sample data model called ‘Order Model’ organizes attributes into a set of five entities, ‘Customer’, ‘Order’, ‘Product’, ‘Salesperson’, and ‘Supplier’.

You should consider creating a data model if you have the following objectives:

* Reduce the number of individual queries that need to be created and maintained
* Provide self-service access to business users
* Provide a simplified view of data that reduces data misrepresentation
* Allow data to be filtered on fields that are not included in a report or Dashboard
* Avoid the need for users to perform joins

. In the ‘Name’ field, enter a label for this database connection.

. From the ‘Database Type’ menu, select ‘Custom’ (if not already selected).

. Enter the name of the driver class in the ‘Driver Class’ field. The name of the driver class is usually provided by the driver vendor.

. Enter the ‘JDBC URL’ that should be used to connect to the database, which has the following form. (You can obtain this from the database administrator.)

 jdbc:paraccel://<host>[:<port>]/<databaseName>

. Enter a ‘Connection Test Query’. This can be any valid database query, and generally should be as simple as possible. The default test query for JDBC 4-compliant databases is `Select 1`, which simply checks if the database can be contacted. Another possible test query is `Select * from Database_Table`, where `Database_Table` is a table in the database schema. This query would check that data can be retrieved from the database.

If the database is shown with an {buttonError}, this means that the connection was not successful.

In this case, check the settings to make sure they are correct for your database. See xref:EditConnection.adoc[] for information on how to change connection settings.

After you have created a connection to the database, you can proceed to define a data set. See xref:dataworksheet:Query42Matters.adoc[].

* In the ‘Path Contains’ field, enter the complete or partial name of the data asset or folder for which to search.
* In the ‘Description Contains’ field, enter a string for which to search the data asset descriptions.
* In the ‘Type is’ field, optionally select the type of the data entity (query, data model attribute, etc.) for which you want to search.

The Data Dictionary table lists all of the matching data assets, along with their types and descriptions.

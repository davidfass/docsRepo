The User Portal provides features for accessing and managing existing assets, such as reports and Dashboards, and allows you to create new assets as well. The User Portal is a web-based interface, so you do not need to install any special software on your computer. Your system administrator will tell you the correct address to use in your web browser.

The specific options available will depend on what permissions you have been granted by the administrator.

= Set JVM Memory

Verify that the minimum system requirements are satisfied: {minimumReq}

To control the amount of memory that the Java JVM assigns to the InetSoft application, edit the *StyleStudio.vmoptions* or *inetsoft-server-{productVersion}.vmoptions* file in the *bin* directory of the installation directory. Use `InitialRAMPercentage` and `MaxRAMPercentage`  to assign a percentage of the machineâ€™s memory, for example:

[source,shellscript]
-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=25.0
-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=60.0

You can also use the `-xmx` and `-xms` flags to assign a specific amount of RAM (e.g., `-Xmx6g`, `-Xms6g`).

WARNING: It is *not recommended* to allocate more than 75% of system RAM.

A group is a collection of users, such as a project team, a department, or a geographical location. (You can create and edit groups in Enterprise Manager only when using the ‘Default’ authentication provider.) Groups are generally organizational in nature, while roles are functional in nature.

To create a new group, follow the steps below:

. Press the {buttonSettings} at the top of Enterprise Manager.
. Select the *Security* page in the left panel.

. Press the ‘New Group’ link below the tree. This creates a group with the default name ‘groupN’ (group0, group1, etc.).

. *_Optional:_* To add a role for users in the group, press the btn:[Add] button in the ‘Roles’ area. Choose the desired role(s) in the ‘Add Role’ dialog box (kbd:[Ctrl]-click to select multiple roles), and press btn:[Add]. Then click the  {buttonEnable} to the role to make it active for user in the group.
. *_Optional:_* To add administrative permission for the group, press the btn:[Add] button in the ‘Administrator Permissions’ area. Choose the desired user(s), groups(s), or role(s) in the ‘Add Permission’ dialog box (kbd:[Ctrl]-click to select multiple items), and press btn:[Add]. Then click the {buttonEnable} next to the user(s), groups(s), or role(s) to grant those users, groups, or roles administrative privileges over the group you are defining. Users, groups, or roles granted such administrative privileges will be able to use Enterprise Manager to remove the group or reassign users and roles to the group.
. To select a Portal theme for the group, choose the desired theme from the ‘Theme’ menu. (See xref:Themes.adoc[] for information about how to create a theme.)
. Press {buttonEMApply} to save your changes.
. Repeat the above steps to add additional groups.

To edit a group, expand the ‘Groups’ node on the tree, and select the desired group. Make the desired changes and press {buttonEMApply}.

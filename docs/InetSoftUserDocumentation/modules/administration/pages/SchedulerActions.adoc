The scheduler action specifies the operations to be performed when the scheduled task runs. (See xref:CreateScheduledTask.adoc[].) There are five types of actions: ‘Report’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘Backup’, ‘Burst’, and ‘User Defined’.

== Report Action
XXXXXXXXX

== Dashboard Action
A Dashboard action executes one or more Dashboards, and delivers them as emails, transmits a notification, or saves a snapshot to the server. If the Dashboard requires *parameter values*, assign these parameters in the 'Creation Parameters' table at the bottom of the page.

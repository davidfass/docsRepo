= Configure Security


There are three steps to setting up security:

. Specify the mechanism for authentication and authorization.  See
xref:SpecifySecurityProvider.adoc[].

. Define users, groups, and roles: See xref:CreateUser.adoc[], xref:CreateGroup.adoc[], and xref:CreateRole.adoc[].

. Set permissions: See xref:SetRepositoryPermissions.adoc[] and xref:SetSecurityActions.adoc[].

The following sections discuss these steps in order.

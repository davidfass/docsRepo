. Select ‘Access requires both User and Role permission’ to specify that access to the Dashboard, report, or folder is granted only if the current user has *both* user *and* role permissions; i.e., both the user’s name (or group) and at least one of the user’s roles appear in the ‘Selected Entities’ table. Select ‘Access requires either User or Role permission’ to specify that access to the Dashboard, report, or folder is granted if the current user has *either* user *or* role permissions; i.e., either the user’s name (or group) or at least one of the user’s roles appear in the ‘Selected Entities’ table.
. Select the desired permission (READ, WRITE, DELETE, SHARE, ADMIN) by checking the boxes next to the users, roles, or groups. Note that ADMIN permission provides privileges for administering the corresponding asset within Enterprise Manager, and therefore implies the  other permissions. The SHARE setting controls access to social sharing options in the Portal.
. Press {buttonEMApply} to save your changes.



[IMPORTANT]
.Notes on Repository Permissions
====

* The ‘Derive permissions from parent folder’ option for a report, Dashboard, or folder specifies that permissions will be derived from the parent folder, as described below. If there are no explicit permissions set for its immediate parent, its permission inheritance will recurse higher up in the hierarchy of folders, until the root folder is reached.
* 'Write' permission on a *folder* indicates that reports, Dashboards, or sub-folders can be added to the folder, deleted from the folder, or modified within the folder.
* 'Delete' permission on a *folder* indicates that the folder itself can be deleted, but does not entail individual delete permission for reports, Dashboards, or sub-folders within the folder. To assign delete permission to all contents of a folder, set the ‘Write’ permission on the parent folder.
* 'Write' permission on an individual *report or Dashboard* indicates that the report or Dashboard can be modified, but does not entail delete permission for the report or Dashboard.  To assign delete permission to a report or Dashboard, set the ‘Delete’ permission on the individual report or Dashboard.
* Every user has full ‘Read’/’Write’/’Delete’ permissions to their own ‘My Reports’ folder.
* If a report _.srt_ file is set to be ‘Read Only’ within the file system, a user cannot save changes to this report.
* If a user has ‘Read’ permissions (but no ‘Write’ permission) on a report, they can save a copy of the report (using ‘Save As’) into any folder on which they have ‘Write’ permission.
* If a user has ‘Read’ permissions on a report but lacks ‘Read’ permissions on its parent folder, the report will not be visible in the Repository tree. However, the report can still be accessed as a hyperlinked report.
* If explicit permissions are set on an individual report, Dashboard, or  folder (i.e.,  ‘Derive permissions from parent folder’ is disabled), the explicit permissions govern the asset and the parent permissions are ignored.

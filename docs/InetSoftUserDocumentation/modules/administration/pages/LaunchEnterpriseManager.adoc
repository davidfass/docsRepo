include::ROOT:partial$minimumRequirements.adoc[]

Enterprise Manager is a web-based tool that allows you to administer the InetSoft  server. To launch the Enterprise Manager in a Microsoft Windows environment, follow these steps:

. In the Windows _Start_ menu, select the _Start InetSoft Server_  link. This launches the default Tomcat web server on the local machine.
. Point a web browser to the Style Intelligence webapp homepage with default URL `http://localhost:8080/`.

. Click the ‘Enterprise Manager’ link. This opens the Enterprise Manager login screen.
. Enter your login credentials, and press ‘Login’.

The default login/password is `admin/admin`. For security reasons, login information expires after five minutes. If you receive a ‘Login Expired’ warning, simply re-enter your credentials to log in.

If the server is already running, you can access the Enterprise Manager by entering the following URL in a web browser:

 http://{servername}:{port}/em

In the address, `\{servername}` should be the name or IP address of the machine running the administration servlet, and `\{port}` should be the application’s assigned port number (default: 8080). For example: http://localhost:8080/em.

Before you begin managing resources and configuring components in Enterprise Manager, verify that you have completed the following steps:

* Set up the repository directory. See xref:SpecifyRepository.adoc[].
* Specify valid license keys. See xref:AdministerLicenseKeys.adoc[].
* Ensure that the minimum system requirements are satisfied. {minimumReq}
* Allocate the desired amount of memory to the JVM. See xref:SetJVMMemory.adoc[] for more information.

NOTE: See Also Security, in Advanced Server Administration, for more details.  XXXXXX?????

A security provider is a module that handles security operations for the InetSoft server. You can specify independent security providers to provide the following functions:

Authentication:: Retrieving users, roles, and groups; authenticating logins.
Authorization:: Storing and retrieving permissions for different components and functions.

To specify a security provider, follow the steps below:

. Press the {buttonSettings} at the top of Enterprise Manager.
. Select the Security page in the left panel.
. Select ‘Enable Security’ to activate security settings.

NOTE: See XXXXXXX for an explanation of how to cascade multiple security providers.

. In the ‘Authentication’ menu, press the {buttonEdit} next to ‘Primary Provider’ or press ‘Add Provider’ and enter a provider name. Select the desired provider type for verifying user login credentials (‘Default’, ‘LDAP’, ‘Database’, or ‘Custom’).
. In the ‘Authorization’ menu, press the {buttonEdit} next to ‘Primary Provider’ or press ‘Add Provider’ and enter a provider name. Select the desired provider type for assigning asset and activity permissions (‘Default’ or ‘Custom’).
. #Optional:# Add any additional authentication or authorization providers by repeating the above steps. Press the {buttonDuplicateContent} for an existing provider to copy those settings to the new provider, if desired.

[NOTE]
.For Chaining Security Providers:
====
* For *authorization*, when the InetSoft server searches for an individual item (user, group, role, permission), it will reference the first provider that contains the item. When it searches for a list all items of a particular type, the set of items from all providers will be used.
* For *authentication*, the first provider that contains the given user will be used to authenticate. Note that if the authentication chain has first Provider 1 and then Provider 2, and both providers contain a given user _but with different credentials_, when the user tries to log in with Provider 2’s credentials, the login will fail. This is because Provider 1 is the first in the chain that contains the user (with different credentials).
* To create a *backup LDAP server*, simply chain together two providers. The first provider in the chain will be the primary LDAP server, and the second provider in the chain will be the backup.
* To facilitate recovery from a change in LDAP or database administrator credential, create a secondary file-based (default) provider that contains a fallback administrative user.

The available provider types are as follows:

Default (File):: This is the built-in security provider, and can be used for both authentication and authorization. See [%=System.Title%] for more information.
LDAP:: This specifies a third-party LDAP server (e.g., Active Directory) that contains your users/groups/roles, and can be used for authentication only. For more information, see Configuring an LDAP Security Provider.
Database:: This specifies queries to retrieve user/role/group information a database schema, and can be used for authentication only. For more information, see Configuring Database Authentication.
Custom:: This specifies a Java class that implements the ‘Security Provider’ interface, and can be used for both authentication and authorization.  Enter the custom configuration in the ‘JSON Configuration’ panel. Security classes have the following methods that you can overwrite to suit your needs:

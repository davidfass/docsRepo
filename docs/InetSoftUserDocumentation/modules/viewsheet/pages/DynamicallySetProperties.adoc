= Dynamically Set Properties
%experimetal%
include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]

Every component in a Dashboard has certain properties that can be made “dynamic,” or dependent on other components. These properties can be set either by an form component or by a logical expression. For example, you can use a radio button to specify the Y-axis field in a chart, or use an expression to add highlights to cells of a table.

The following sections explain how you can use form controls to parameterize component formatting and data presentation, as well as data filtering. By associating a form control such as a RadioButton or ComboBox with the property setting for a component, you allow the user to adjust that setting by manipulating the corresponding control.

== Control Properties with Form components
To parametrize a component property using a Form component, follow these steps:

. Create and configure the Form component. Follow the steps below:
.. Add the desired form control (RadioButton, CheckBox, etc.) to the Dashboard.
.. Right-click the form component, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Properties’ panel for the Form component.
.. Under the *General* tab, use the ‘Name’ field to assign the form component a meaningful name. This is the name used to refer to the component.
.. Specify the ‘List Values’ for the form component by manually entering ‘Embedded’ values or by specifying a ‘Query’ to provide the values. (See xref:SliderSpinnerProperties.adoc[] and xref:RadioCheckBoxComboProperties.adoc[] for further details.)
.. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Properties’ dialog box.
. Link the form control to the component property you want to manipulate. Follow the steps below:
.. Right-click the component you want to control, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Properties’ panel for the controlled component.

.. Locate the property that you wish to control, press the {buttonValueType} and select ‘Variable’.

NOTE: You can specify a form control for any property that offers the ‘Variable’ option.

.. From the pop-up menu, select the form component that should control the property.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you link a Form component with a component property, you should ensure that the form control evaluates to a permissible value for the particular property. There are three main cases.

* *Property Requires a Numerical Value*: If a property requires a numerical value, the Form component should provide an appropriate numerical value. For example, the ‘Ranking’ property in the Chart data binding (shown below) requires an integer value. An appropriate control for this property would therefore be a Spinner with ‘Increment’ property set to an integer value.
+

* *Property Requires a Boolean Value*: If a property has a ‘True’ or ‘False’ setting, the Form component should provide a Boolean value. For example, the ‘Enabled’ property expects a Boolean value ‘true’ or ‘false’. An appropriate control for this property would therefore be a RadioButton with embedded list values {true, false}, and with ‘Data Type’ set to ‘Boolean’.
* *Property Requires a String Value*: If a property requires one of a fixed set of strings, the Form component should provide a string from the set. For example, the ‘Visible’ property requires one of the strings ‘Show’, ‘Hide’, or ‘Hide on Print and Export’. The Form component must therefore return one of these strings. An appropriate control for this property would therefore be a RadioButton with embedded list values {‘Show’, ‘Hide’, ‘Hide on Print and Export’}, and with ‘Data Type’ set to ‘String’.
====

.. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Properties’ dialog box for the controlled component.

The specified form control will now provide the value of the selected property.

In this example, you will add a RadioButton that allows the user to set the Y-axis field of a chart to either ‘Quantity Purchased’ or ‘Total Revenue’.

. Create a new Dashboard based on the ‘ProductSales’ Data Worksheet.
include::ROOT:partial$CreateNewWorksheetNote.adoc[]
+
include::ROOT:partial$ProductSalesWorksheet.adoc[]

. Add a Radio Button to the Dashboard, with two embedded values (‘Quantity Purchased’ and ‘Total’).
. Add a Chart to the Dashboard, and open the Chart Editor. (See xref:AddAChart.adoc[].) Add the ‘State’ field from the ‘SalesByDate’ data block to the X-axis and the ‘Quantity Purchased’ field as the Y-axis.
. Press the {buttonValueType} next to ‘Quantity Purchased’, and choose the ‘Variable’ option. The menu displays the available variable names.

== Control Filter Conditions with Form Components
Form components allow a user to manipulate a filter or highlight condition applied to a data view component (Chart, Table, Crosstab).

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to understand the distinction between Form components and Filter components:

Form components (Combo Box, Radio Button, etc.)::
* Allow the user to dynamically control properties of Dashboard components.
* Allow the user to pass user input to an Embedded Table or Variable in an underlying Data Worksheet.
Filter components (Selection List, Calendar, etc.):: Allow the user to dynamically restrict the data displayed in Charts, Tables, Text, and Gauges so that the user can visualize  the data in different ways.

Although you can use a Form component to achieve dynamic filtering  in the Dashboard (as shown below) or in a Data Worksheet (see xref:dataworksheet:FilterData.adoc[] in xref:dataworksheet:PrepareYourData.adoc[]), in most cases you should perform filtering operations by using the available Filter components. See xref:FilterDashboard.adoc[] for more information.
====

To control a condition using a Form component, follow these steps:

. Create and configure the Form component, following the steps below:
.. Add the desired Form component (RadioButton, CheckBox, etc.) to the Dashboard.
.. Right-click the Form component, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Properties’ panel for the Form component.
.. Under the *General* tab, use the ‘Name’ field to assign the Form component a meaningful name. This will be the name used to refer to the component.
.. Specify the ‘List Values’ for the form component by manually entering ‘Embedded’ values or by specifying a ‘Query’ to provide the values. (See xref:SliderSpinnerProperties.adoc[] and xref:RadioCheckBoxComboProperties.adoc[] for further details.)
.. Press btn:[OK] to close the Form component ‘Properties’ dialog box.
. Link the Form component to the filter condition or highlight condition of the data view component that you want the user to manipulate. Follow the steps below:
.. Right-click the data view component you wish to highlight or filter, and select ‘Highlight’ or ‘Condition’ (as desired) from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Highlight’ or ‘Condition’ panel for the component.
.. Create the left side of the condition as described under xref:ConditionalFormat.adoc[] and xref:AddConditions.adoc[], e.g., `[State][is][one of]`.
.. Press the {buttonValueType} and select ‘Variable’.
+
image:Variable Select Popup Condition.png[]
From the adjacent pop-up menu, select the Form component that you want to control the value.
+
image:Variable Selection Condition.png[]
.. Press btn:[Append] to add the condition, and press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Condition’ dialog box.

The specified Form component will now provide the value for the right side of the condition.

.. In the ‘List Values Selection’ dialog box, select the ‘Sales’ data block in the left panel, and then select ‘State’ in both the ‘Label’ and ‘Value’ menus.
+
image:ParameterHighlightListSelectDialog.png[]
.. Press btn:[OK] to close both dialog boxes. This binds the CheckBox component to the ‘State’ field of the data block.
. On the Dashboard, select the CheckBox component. Drag the handles to expand the component so that all state options are visible.
+

. Drag a Table component from the *Toolbox* panel to the Dashboard.
. Expand the ‘Sales’ data block at the top of the *Toolbox* panel, and drag the following fields into the Table: ‘Category’, ‘Company’, ‘City’, ‘State’, ‘Total’.
. Enlarge the table so that at least 10 rows are visible.
+
image:ParameterHighlightTableAndList.png[]
. Right-click a cell in the ‘City’ field of the Table, and select ‘Highlight’ from the context menu. This opens the ‘Highlight’ panel for the ‘City’ field.
. In the ‘Highlight’ panel, press btn:[Add] and enter the name “CityHighlight”.
. For the ‘Background’ property, select yellow.
. In the ‘Conditions’ panel, press btn:[Edit] to open the ‘Conditions’ dialog box.
+
image:ParameterHighlightDefine.png[]
. In the ‘Conditions’ dialog box, create the left side of the condition by making the following menu selections: `[State][is][one of]`.
. Press the {buttonValueType} and select ‘Variable’.
. From the adjacent pop-up menu, select the “StateSelector” Form component.
+
image:ParameterHighlightDefineVariable.png[]
. Press btn:[Append] to add the condition, and press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Conditions’ dialog box.
. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Highlight’ panel.

On the Dashboard, make selections in the CheckBox component, and observe how this highlights the cities in the Table that correspond to the selected states.

== Control Properties with Script

You can enter a script in any property field that provides the{buttonValueType}  with an ‘Expression’ option.
+
image:Expression Select Popup.png[]

For example, to add a script to a component expression field, follow the steps below:

. Right-click the component, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Properties’ panel.
+
image:Right Click Properties.png[]

. In the ‘Properties’ panel, find the property you wish to dynamically change. (In the example, we use the ‘Visible’ property under the *General* tab.)
. Press the {buttonValueType} next to the property you want to modify, and select ‘Expression’ from the menu. This enables the {buttonEditFormula}.
+
image:Expression Option.png[]
. Press the {buttonEditFormula} to open the Formula Editor.
+image:Edit Expression Button.png[]

. In the Formula Editor, enter the desired script. For example, the following script hides the component if the user has selected ‘Hide’ from a RadioButton control, and the current month is March (i.e., the third month).
[source,javascript]
if ((RadioButton1['selectedObject']=='Hide')
          && (CALC.today().getMonth() == 3)) {
  "Hide"
}
else {
  "Show"
}
+
IMPORTANT: The script must return one of the options in the property menu. For example, return values for the ‘Visible’ property must be one of “Show,” “Hide,” or “Hide on Print and Export.” (To achieve “Show on Print and Export” behavior, use the special expression `!visible`.)
+
To automatically insert a function (such as `CALC.today()`), click the corresponding option in the ‘Functions’ list above the edit area. To automatically insert a reference to another component’s property, click the corresponding option in the ‘Component’ list above the edit area.
+

. Press btn:[OK] to close the Formula Editor, and press  btn:[OK] to close the ‘Properties’ dialog box.
+
NOTE: An expression script can reference properties of its hosting component without full qualification. For example, in a script placed on component Chart1, 'Chart1.selectedObject' and 'selectedObject' refer to the same property.

Expressions must always return permissible values for the corresponding property. For example, if a property requires an integer, an expression that sets that property must evaluate to an integer. If a property requires one of a fixed set of options, e.g., {‘Rows’, ‘Columns’}, then the expression that sets that property must evaluate identically to one of those strings (‘Rows’ or ‘Columns’).

== Submit Form Settings in Batch
To submit settings from all Form components in batch by using a Submit button, follow the steps below:

. Add a Submit button to the Dashboard. (See  xref:SubmitButtonProperties.adoc[] for more information.)
. Repeat the following for each Form component in the Dashboard: Right-click the component, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. In the ‘Properties’ dialog box, *_disable_* the ‘Submit on Change’ option located in the  *General* tab.

The Submit button will now batch-submit all Form selections, as well as selections made in any Filter components that similarly have the ‘Submit on Change’ option disabled.

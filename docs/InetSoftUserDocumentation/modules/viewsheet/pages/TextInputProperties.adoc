The Text Input component’s ‘Properties’ panel provides *General*, *Option*, and *Script* tabs. The next sections discuss the component-specific properties available under these tabs.

== General Tab
In addition to the common properties, the *General* tab in the ‘Text Input Properties’ panel provides the following properties.

Submit on Change::	When enabled (default), submits the entered value when user presses ‘Enter’ or clicks away. Otherwise, a separate ‘Submit’ button is required.
Refresh Dashboard after Submit::	Force the dashboard to refresh when the user submits a value from the Form component.
Default Text::	Specifies the text to appear within the TextInput field when it is first displayed. (This is often a hint to the user about what data should be entered). This default text is automatically removed when the user begins entering data.
Inset Border Style::	Specifies a dimensional “inset” (rather than flat) appearance for the component border.
Multiple Lines::	When enabled, allows the user to enter multiple lines of text into the text area.

== Option Tab
The *Option* tab in the ‘TextInput Properties’ panel allows you to select an *Input Editor* which specifies the control interface and validation for user input. See xref:viewsheetscript:ValidateUserInput.adoc[] for details on the available editors.

== Script Tab

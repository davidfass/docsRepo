There are a variety of ways that you can drill down into your data. The following sections explain the basic different approaches.

== Brush a Chart
Brushing is a powerful tool that helps you to quickly detect and understand relationships your data. This feature is available both to designers and end-users.



Consider the following charts. (See xref:BasicChartingSteps.adoc[] for instructions on how to create a chart.)

Use brushing to answer the following questions. (Expand the sections to see the answers.)

****
.In what month did salesperson Sue Marston have peak sales?
[%collapsible]
====
. Double-click the ‘Sue’ label in the legend to brush Sue Marston’s sales in both charts.
+

== Zoom a Chart
The Zoom feature allows you focus in on a selected set of groups by specifying the groups to include or exclude from the zoomed view.

=== Select Groups to Include
To zoom in by selecting the groups you want to view, follow the steps below:

. Select the data on the chart that you wish to zoom.
+
include::viewsheet:partial$selectChartData.adoc[]


. Press the {buttonZoom} in the mini-toolbar. This zooms the chart to display only the data selected.
+
image:Chart Zoom Basic.png[]

. Repeat the above steps to zoom in further.

. To return to the original chart view, press the {buttonChartClearZoom}.
+

=== Select Groups to Exclude
In some cases,  you might find it easier to create the desired view by specifying particular groups to _exclude_ from the zoomed view.

. Select the data on the chart that you wish to exclude from the zoomed view.
+
include::viewsheet:partial$selectChartData.adoc[]

Press the {buttonChartExclude} in the toolbar. This removes the selected data from the chart.
+
image:ExcludeData.png[]

. Repeat the above steps to exclude further data.

. To return to the original chart view, press the {buttonChartClearZoom}.
+

== Drilling Through a Chart
When a chart axis displays a date field or a cube dimension, the chart automatically provides the user with the ability to drill down to finer levels of resolution of the date or dimension.

To drill down into a date or cube dimension on a chart axis, follow these steps:

. Hover the mouse over the chart axis that you want to display at greater resolution. For axes that represent date or cube dimension data, this will display a {buttonDrillDown} at the left side of the axis.
+
IMPORTANT: The {buttonDrillDown} is only visible when you hover over the axis.
+
image:DrillDown.png[]

. Press the {buttonDrillDown} to drill down to the next level of the date or dimension.

. Repeat the above steps to drill down to deeper levels of the hierarchy.
+
image:DrillDown2.png[]

. To drill up to a higher level of the date or dimension hierarchy, hover the mouse over the chart axis that you want to display at reduced resolution. This displays a {buttonDrillUp} at the left side of the axis.
+
image:DrillDown3.png[]

. Press the {buttonDrillUp} to drill up to the higher level of the date or dimension hierarchy.



[NOTE]
====
When you drill down into a discretely grouped date axis (e.g., date grouping level set to ‘Quarter of Year’, ‘Month of Year’, etc.), this creates a facet chart by repeatedly adding the date field as an additional dimension with a finer grouping level.

image:DrillDown4.png[]

However, when you drill down into  a continuously grouped date axis (e.g.,  date grouping level set to ‘Quarter’, ‘Month’, etc.), this changes the grouping level of the existing dimension rather than adding an additional dimension.

image:DrillDown5.png[]

The exception to this rule is the ‘Year’ level, which behaves as a discrete grouping and generates a facet chart upon drill down (as illustrated in the steps above).

====
To disable the drilling feature for a particular chart, deselect the ‘Enable Drilling’ option in the *Advanced* tab of the ‘Chart Properties’ panel. To specify a custom drill hierarchy, including custom date levels, see xref:ChartProperties.adoc[].


== Drill Through a Crosstab
When a Crosstab header displays a date field or a cube dimension, the Crosstab automatically provides the user with the ability to drill down to finer levels of resolution of the date or dimension.

To drill down into a date or cube dimension on a Crosstab header, follow these steps:


. Hover the mouse over the Crosstab. For headers that represent date or cube dimension data, this will display an {buttonDrillDown} at the left side of the header.
+
IMPORTANT: The {buttonDrillDown} is only visible when you hover over the Crosstab.
+
image:DrillDownCross.png[]

. Press the {buttonDrillDown} to drill down to the next level of the date or dimension.

. Repeat the above steps to drill down to deeper levels of the hierarchy.
+
image:DrillDownCross2.png[]

. To drill up to a higher level of the date or dimension hierarchy, hover the mouse over the crosstab. This displays a {buttonDrillUp} at the left side of expanded headers.
+
image:DrillDownCross3.png[]

. Press the {buttonDrillUp} to drill up to the higher level of the date or dimension hierarchy.

. To fully expand the hierarchy for a dimension value, right-click the value and select the appropriate ‘Expand Hierarchy’ option. To collapse an expanded hierarchy, select ‘Collapse Hierarchy’.
+
image:expandHierarchy1.png[]

. To fully expand all of the hierarchies for a dimension (column or row header), right-click a value of the dimension and select the appropriate ‘Expand Field’ option. To collapse an expanded hierarchy, select ‘Collapse Field’.
+
image:expandHierarchy2.png[]

. To fully expand *_all_*   hierarchies in the entire crosstab, right-click the table title and select ‘Expand Hierarchy’. To collapse all hierarchies in an expanded table, select ‘Collapse Hierarchy’.
+
image:expandHierarchy3.png[]

To disable the drilling feature for a particular crosstab, deselect the ‘Enable Drilling’ option in the *Advanced* tab of the ‘Crosstab Properties’ dialog box. To specify a custom drill hierarchy, including custom date levels, see xref:CrosstabProperties.adoc[].

== Drill to Crosstab Detail Data
To drill-down into the data in a Crosstab table, follow the steps below:

. Select the aggregated data into which you want to drill.
+
[TIP]
====
You can select data in a Crosstab in the following ways:

* Click to select individual cells.
* Hold down the {buttonShift} key and click to select a contiguous ranges of cells.
* Hold down the {buttonCtrl} key and click to select discontiguous ranges of cells.
====

. Press the {buttonShowDetails} in the title bar.
+

This displays the detail data in the *Data* panel.
+
image:CrosstabDetails3.png[]
+
You can continue to select different cells without clicking ‘Show Details’ again. (You may need to collapse the *Data* panel to resume making selections on the Crosstab.)

. *_Optional:_* To format values in the data panel, press the {buttonFormat} in the column header that you want to format.
+

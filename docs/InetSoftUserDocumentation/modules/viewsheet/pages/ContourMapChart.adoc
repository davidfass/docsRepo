= Contour Map Chart
%experimental%
include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]

This chart type combines a xref:MapChart.adoc[] with a xref:ScatterContourChart.adoc[] to display density data either based on regional information (country, state, city, etc.) or based on latitude and longitude.   For information on creating maps with user-defined regions, see xref:administration:CreateCustomMap.adoc[] in xref:administration:ManageServer.adoc[].

. *_Optional:_* If your geographical field represents areas on the Chart (e.g., states) rather than points (e.g., cities), adjust the ‘Alpha’ setting to  less than 100% so that the filled regions do not obscure the underlying map background.

. Press btn:[OK] to exit the ‘Chart Properties’ dialog box.


. Mark the *dimensions* you want to use on the map as _geographical fields_.  To do this, see xref:SetGeographicalField[].
+
include::ROOT:partial$dimensionTip.adoc[]




If your columns contain longitude and latitude data (in decimal format) rather than location names, use the ‘Longitude’ and ‘Latitude’ fields of the ‘Data’ panel.Mark the s you want to use on the map as geographical fields.






. From the ‘Dimensions’ folder of the *Data Source* panel, drag a desired *dimension* to the ‘X’ or ‘Y’ region.

== Set a Geographical Field


To mark a field as geographical, follow these steps…
Right-click the field in the tree or press the , and select ‘Set Geographic’ from the context menu. This places a  next to the field name.

If the field is shown with a , this means the field has been already been mapped to a geographical level. If the field is shown with an , this means you may need to set the geographical level for the field or resolve location names.
To set the geographical level, right-click the field name and select ‘Edit Geographic’ from the context menu. This opens the ‘Edit Geographic’ dialog box.

The map that you select for a geographic field applies to all other geographical fields.Note: It is not possible to create a custom map in Style ScopeVisualize Free.
In the ‘Edit Geographic’ dialog box, select the desired region from the ‘Map’ menu: Asia, Canada, Europe, Mexico, U.S., or World.
From the ‘Layer’ menu, select the geographical layer that corresponds to the data in the selected field.
This specifies the layer of the geographical database against which field values should be matched (e.g., city names should be matched against the city layer, etc.). The options available in the ‘Layer’ menu depend on the previously selected ‘Map’ option.
From the ‘Mapping’ menu, select the desired map database.
The Chart Editor attempts to resolve values in the selected geographic field against the corresponding layer in the map database. If the field was shown with an , this means you may need to resolve location names. To do this, press the  next to the ‘Mapping’ menu. This opens the ‘Geographic Mapping’ dialog box, which allows you to manually match place names. Make any required matches and press ‘OK’.

To remove the geographical status of a field, right click the field or press the , and select ‘Clear Geographic’ from the context menu.








. To break-out the dataset into groups using color, shape, size, or text labeling, drag a dimension from the data source to  the ‘Color’, ‘Shape’, ‘Size’, or ‘Text’ region.

. To break-out the data into groups without applying any visual formatting, drag a dimension to the ‘Break By/Tooltip’ region.

. *_Optional:_* {multipleDimensionNoColor}

. *_Optional:_* For a date dimension, press the {buttonEditDimension} next to the field name in the Chart Editor, and set the ‘Level’ to the desired date grouping. Then press the {buttonApply}.

. From the ‘Measures’ folder of the *Data Source* panel, drag a *measure* to the ‘X’ or ‘Y’ region. This places the selected field onto the chart as a measure.

You can filter data at the query level, data preparation/mashup level (Data Worksheet) or presentation level (Dashboard).

When you perform filtering in a query or Data Worksheet, *only* the filtered data will be available for further manipulation and presentation (although the filter itself can be parameterized and controlled from a Dashboard or report; see xref:_filter_using_dynamic_conditions[] below). This approach may be most efficient when you want to use the filtered data across many Dashboards or reports. To provide the user with the greatest flexibility to adjust the filtering, it is often more effective to perform filtering at the presentation level (Dashboard).

To filter at the dashboard level, see xref:viewsheet:FilterDashboard.adoc[].  To filter at the query level, see xref:QueryData.adoc[].  To filter at the Data Worksheet level, see the sections below:

== Filter Detail Data
To filter the detail (pre-aggregate) data in a data block, follow the steps below. Note: If you want Dashboard users to dynamically filter the data in a Dashboard, see xref:viewsheet:FilterDashboard.adoc[] instead.

You can now use this Data Worksheet as the data source for a Dashboard. See xref:viewsheet:VisualizeYourData.adoc[] to create a Dashboard.


== Filter Using Dynamic Conditions
There are several different ways to make a data block filtering condition more dynamic by incorporating user input, session data, and so on. The following sections explain these approaches.

NOTE: If you want to apply dynamic conditions at the Dashboard level (rather than at the data level), see xref:viewsheet:FilterDashboard.adoc[].

=== Use a Variable (Parameter) in a Condition
You can use a _variable_ or _parameter_ as the test value in a filter condition. By default, the user of the Dashboard or report will be prompted  to enter the value of any parameters required by Data Worksheet conditions. The parameter value can also be supplied from other sources  (report parameter, Dashboard parameter or input component, user session data, report or Dashboard script.)

To use a variable or parameter in a filter condition, follow these steps:

. #Optional:#  To reference a  _Variable_ object in the condition,  create a new Variable or drag an existing Variable from the *Asset* panel into the right panel.  See xref:CreateNewVariable.adoc[] for more about how to create the Variable object.
+
NOTE: You do not need to use a Variable object in order to parametrize a condition, but a using Variable object gives you more control over the parameter’s properties and prompting.

. #Optional:#  To control the value of a  _Variable_ object from a Dashboard,  link a Dashboard Form component to the variable.
+

[%collapsible]
====
A user can modify the  value of a Variable in the Data Worksheet by using a Dashboard Form component. To configure Dashboard control of a Variable, follow these steps:

. Open the Dashboard for editing. (See xref:viewsheet:EditADashboard.adoc[].)

. Add the desired Form component to the Dashboard. (See xref:viewsheet:DynamicallySetProperties.adoc[] for more information about Form components.)
. Right-click on the Form component in the Dashboard, and select ‘Properties’.
. Select the *Data* tab in the ‘Properties’ panel.
. Open the ‘Target’ menu. Expand the ‘Variable’ node, and select the desired Variable asset in the Data Worksheet.
+
image:viewsheet:formControlVariable.gif[]
. Press btn:[OK] to exit the ‘Properties’ panel.

The Form control is now linked to the Data Worksheet Variable, and changes the user makes using the control will alter the values in the  Variable. To set the options displayed by the Form control, see xref:viewsheet:RadioCheckBoxComboProperties.adoc[].

. Press ‘OK’ to close the  ‘Condition’ panel.

=== Use Session Data in a Condition
To use a session variable (user, group, or role) as the test value in a filter condition, follow the steps below.

IMPORTANT: While session-based conditions can be used to control data access, you should implement comprehensive data security  by using a VPM.  See xref:SecureData.adoc[].

image:Expression in Condition.gif[]

. Press the ‘SQL’ or ‘JS’ button at the left of the text field to choose the expression type.
+
Expressions that use SQL syntax are processed by the database, while expressions that use JavaScript syntax are post-processed. Because post-processing is CPU-intensive for the query engine, and may additionally cause retrieval of a large amounts of raw data, it is preferable to use SQL syntax when possible. Note, however, that SQL functions are database-specific and vary from one database to another.
+
NOTE: Use SQL expressions whenever possible.

+
image:SubQueryDialog.gif[]
. In the ‘Subquery’ menu, specify the desired sub-query data block. (This is the data block created when you dragged the query from the *Asset* panel to the right panel.)
. Select options in the lower three menus, as needed. You do not need to make a selection in every menu; this depends on how you want to use the sub-query result. The ‘In column’ menu specifies the sub-query column that contains the result set to use in the condition. The bottom two menus control table synchronization for row-dependent conditions.
+
.Expand to see different ways to use a sub-query...
[%collapsible]
====
You do not need to specify every setting in the ‘Subquery’ dialog box. The required menu choices depend on how you wish to use the sub-query result set. This section explains three different ways that you can use a sub-query.

Subquery Returns a Fixed Value:: If the sub-query returns a single fixed value (i.e., the sub-query data block in the Data Worksheet contains a single data cell), then in the ‘Subquery’ dialog box you only need to specify the _name_ of the sub-query. No further settings are required.

Subquery Returns a Fixed List:: If you want to use a particular column from the sub-query as a fixed list in the condition, you need to specify the query name in the ‘Subquery’ dialog box, and then select the desired sub-query column from the ‘In column’ menu. A sub-query that returns a column is typically used in conjunction with the ‘one of’ condition operator to filter values that are members (or non-members) of the returned list. For this usage, you do not need to make selections in the ‘Subquery column’ and ‘Current table column’ menus.  See Example 1 below.

Subquery Returns a Row-Dependent Value:: A sub-query can return a value that is dependent on the *row* of the filtered data block. Such a row-dependent sub-query is useful when you want to filter rows of a data block based on  comparison with corresponding rows of the sub-query.
+
For example, consider a case where one data bock returns sales by year for NY, and a second data block returns sales by year for CA. You want the NY data block to return records _only_ for those years where sales were greater than sales in CA. For instance, you want the NY data block to return a record for year 2002 _only if_ sales in NY for 2002 were greater than sales in CA for 2002.
+
To configure a row-dependent sub-query, follow these steps:
+
. Select the desired sub-query column from the ‘In column’ menu. This is the column of the sub-query containing the actual values to be tested in the condition. (In the example above, this would be the ‘sales’ column of the CA data block, since this column contains the values that the condition will test.)
. From the ‘Subquery column’ menu, select the column in the _subquery data block_ that indexes the sub-query condition column (selected in the previous step). The ‘Subquery column’ is the sub-query join column; it will be used to look up the condition values corresponding to a particular row in the filtered data block. (In the example above, the ‘Subquery column’ would be the ‘year’ column of the CA data block, since this is the column that indexes the ‘sales’ column of the CA data block.)
. From the ‘Current table column’ menu, select the column in the _filtered data block_ that contains the indexing values corresponding to those in the ‘Subquery column’ of the sub-query data block. (In the example above, the ‘Current table column’ would be the ‘year’ column of the NY data block, since this is the column that corresponds to the CA ‘year’ column.)

+
The ‘Subquery column’ and ‘Current table column’ link the sub-query data block and filtered data block. For each row in filtered data block, the value in the ‘Current table column’ is matched against the values in the ‘Subquery column’. The results returned by the sub-query for each row are the values of the condition ‘In column’ in the rows where the ‘Subquery column’ value is matched. See Example 2 below.

.Subquery Returns a Fixed List
[example]
=====
Assume that you have a data block returning companies that purchased a ‘Wireless Mouse’ product, and a second data block returning companies that purchased a ‘Fast Go Game’ product. You would like to filter the ‘Wireless Mouse’ data to show only the companies that _did not_ purchased the ‘Fast Go Game.’ To do this, define a condition on the ‘Wireless Mouse’ data bock that uses the ‘Fast Go Game’ data as a sub-query.

Follow the steps below:
. Create a new Data Worksheet.
+
include::ROOT:partial$CreateNewWorksheetNote.adoc[]

. Drag the ‘Fast Go Game’ query from the left panel into the right panel. This creates a new data block named ‘Fast Go Game1’.
+
include::ROOT:partial$FastGoGameQuery.adoc[]

. Drag the ‘Wireless Mouse’ query from the left panel into the right panel. This creates a new data block named ‘Wireless Mouse1’.
+
image:twoDWSQueries_3.gif[]

. In the ‘Fast Go Game1’ data block, rename the ‘Customers’ column to ‘Customers_FGG’.  This will make the next steps more clear.  See xref:ModifyColumn.adoc[] for how to rename a column.
+
include::ROOT:partial$duplicateNames.adoc[]

. Click the ‘Wireless Mouse1’ data block to select it.
. Press the {buttonDefineCondition} button in the bottom panel.
+
image:SubQueryConditionButton.gif[]
+
This opens the ‘Condition’ panel.
+
image:ConditionDialog.gif[]
. Press the btn:[More] button.
. Use the menus to specify the following expression:
+
 [Customers] [is not] [one of]

. To use a sub-query in the condition, press the {buttonChangeValueType} and select ‘Subquery’. This displays the ‘Subquery’ button.
+
image:SubQueryExampleList.gif[]

. Press the btn:[Subquery] button to open the ‘Subquery’ dialog box.
. Select ‘Fast Go Game1’ from the ‘Subquery’ menu. This is the name of the sub-query data block.
. Select ‘Customers_FGG’ from the ‘In column’ menu. This is the column of the sub-query that contains the list of values to use in the condition expression.
+
image:SubQueryExampleDialog.gif[]

. Press ‘OK’ to close the ‘Subquery’ dialog box. (You do not need to make selections from the bottom two menus.)
. Press ‘OK’ to exit the ‘Condition’ panel. The data blocks are now linked by a {buttonSubquery} to indicate that the ‘Fast Go Game1’ data block provides a sub-query result to the ‘Wireless Mouse1’ data block.
. Preview the data returned by the ‘Wireless Mouse1’ data block. (Click the data block to select it. Then press the {buttonChangeView} in the bottom panel and select {buttonLiveDataView}.)
+

.Subquery returns a row-dependent value
[example]
=====
This example illustrates how to use a row-dependent sub-query. Suppose you have the total sales for all product categories, both for this week and last week. However, you want to display only those product categories that have yielded more sales revenue this week than last week. To do this, you can use last week’s total sales as a sub-query to provide the data for the condition you place on this week’s sales table.

. Create the ‘Sales this week’ data block:
.. Expand the sample Order Model, and drag the ‘Category’ and ‘Total’ columns from the ‘Product’ entity to create a new data block. (The ‘Order Model’ data model can be found in the menu:Examples[Orders] folder.)
+

image:SubQueryExampleRowDep3.gif[]
.. Press ‘OK’.
.. Press the {buttonGroupAndAggregate} in the bottom panel to open the *Group and Aggregate* panel.
+
image:SubQueryExampleRowDep5.gif[]
.. Set the data block to group by ‘Category’ and aggregate by ‘Total’. Then press btn:[OK].
. Create the ‘Sales last week’ data block:
.. Make a copy of the ‘Sales this week’ data block. (See xref:CopyData.adoc[] for more information.)
.. Rename the copy ‘Sales last week’.
.. Change the condition on the ‘Sales last week’ data block to the following: `[Order Date] [is] [in range] [Last week]`.
.. In the bottom panel, double-the ‘Category’ column header, and change the name to ‘Category_LW’. (This will avoid confusion with the ‘Category’ column in the other data block.)
.. In the same way, rename the ‘Total’ column to ‘Total_LW’.
+
. Click the ‘Sales this week’ data block to select it. Press the {buttonDefineCondition} in the bottom panel. This opens the *Condition* panel again.

. Press the ‘Subquery’ button. This opens the ‘Subquery’ dialog box.
. Select ‘Sales last week’ from the ‘Subquery’ menu.
. Select ‘Total_LW’ from the ‘In column’ menu. This is the column of the sub-query containing the values to be used in the condition test.
. Select ‘Category_LW’ from ‘Subquery column’. This is the sub-query column that will be matched up against the ‘Current table column’ in the filtered data block. (It is the “join column” of the sub-query data block.)
. Select ‘Product.Category’ from the ‘Current table column’ menu. This is the filtered data block column that will be matched up against the ‘Subquery column’ in the sub-query data block. (It is the “join column” of the filtered data block.)

== Filter Materialized View Data

You can create conditions for a data block that determine how and when the data block’s materialized view is updated. A materialized view is a high-performance caching mechanism for Dashboards. (See xref:administration:IncrementalUpdate.adoc[]  for background on incremental updates.)

To specify the materialized view update conditions for a data block, follow the steps below:

. Click the data block to select it.
. Press the  button in the bottom panel. This opens the ‘Condition’ panel.
+
image:ConditionButton.gif[]

. Select the *MV Update* tab.
. In the special case where you are using an *unmergeable query*, enable the ‘Always append updates’ option. Otherwise, leave it disabled. See xref:administration:IncrementalUpdate.adoc[] for information about using this property for unmergeable queries.
. Press the btn:[Edit] button corresponding to the type of update condition you wish to create. The available options are as follows:
Append Records Matching Pre-aggregate Condition:: Create a condition which selects records to add to the existing materialized view based on the pre-aggregate values of data (prior to grouping and summarization).
Append Records Matching Post-aggregate Condition:: Create a condition which selects records to add to the existing materialized view based on the post-aggregate values of data (subsequent to grouping and summarization).
Delete Records Matching Pre-aggregate Condition:: Create a condition which selects records to delete from the existing materialized view based on the pre-aggregate values of data (prior to grouping and summarization).
Delete Records Matching Post-aggregate Condition:: Create a condition which selects records to delete from the existing materialized view based on the post-aggregate values of data (subsequent to grouping and summarization).

+
When you press the desired btn:[Edit] button, this opens the ‘Conditions’ dialog box.
. Use the menus to enter the desired condition. (See above  for general information on specifying conditions.)
+
NOTE: To prevent a delete condition from being applied on the initial materialized view generation, add the following special tag into the expression script: `//@incrementalOnly`.
+
image:ConditionDialogMV.gif[]
If you select the ‘Expression’ option for the right side of the condition, follow the additional steps below:
+
image:MVUpdateExpressionOption.gif[]

.. For append operations, press the btn:[SQL/JS] button to select the desired expression language, SQL or JavaScript.
+
NOTE: The btn:[SQL/JS] option is not available for deletions. Deletion expressions must use JavaScript syntax.

.. Press the {buttonEditFormula}. This opens the Formula Editor.
.. Enter the desired expression. You can use any available functions and operators, in addition to the special parameters `MV.LastUpdatedTime`, `MV.MaxValue`, and `MV.MinValue`.

MV.LastUpdatedTime:: This represents the time at which the materialized view for the data block was last updated. You can use this value in a condition expression to incrementally update the materialized view with records that have posted to the database since the last materialized view update. For example, the condition below updates the current materialized view with records having a “transaction date” subsequent to the previous materialization.

 [transaction_date][is][greater than][MV.LastUpdatedTime]

MV.MaxValue:: This represents the maximum value of the field specified in the left-side menu of the materialized view condition. For example, in the condition below, `MV.MaxValue` represents the maximum value of the ‘Total’ field.
+
image:MVUpdateMaxValue.gif[]

MV.MinValue:: This represents the minimum value in the field specified in the left-side menu of the materialized view condition.
.. Press btn:[OK] to close the Formula Editor.
. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Condition’ panel.

The specified condition(s) will be evaluated when any materialized view based on this data block is regenerated. The materialized view will be updated in accordance with the conditions specified. In general, incrementally updating a materialized view in this way is significantly faster than regenerating the materialized view in its entirety.
